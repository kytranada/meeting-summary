[2025-05-13 11:53:44]  This is also got missed. When we did a follow-up, they said that
[2025-05-13 11:53:51]  Yeah, but this particular user story is we can.
[2025-05-13 11:53:55]  the grading and
[2025-05-13 11:54:03]  and address the comments from the PCT and we will be the
[2025-05-13 11:54:17]  And I would like to speak anyways we are talking on this one.
[2025-05-13 11:54:24]  story building like yesterday for the lines 30 days cross
[2025-05-13 11:54:31]  It's like a...
[2025-05-13 11:54:45]  I mean, ideally if I can put it 21 user story points, I would definitely put it on that one. As you see, the PCT reviews, code reviews and all deployment processes.
[2025-05-13 11:54:53]  and that will take a 13-point development as it I have told you right.
[2025-05-13 11:55:01]  and we have to streamline the system and we thought of introducing ETNAPA colon all right
[2025-05-13 11:55:07]  on that one but yeah I don't know like
[2025-05-13 11:55:11]  want to ask two users stories on that.
[2025-05-13 11:55:17]  it belonged that one to go ahead and look into it.
[2025-05-13 11:55:20]  I didn't have a chance to.
[2025-05-13 11:55:26]  Miss all the me. Yeah, please let me know just to give you an
[2025-05-13 11:55:29]  They can still defect the
[2025-05-13 11:55:37]  I cannot take it up as a defect and work as I said, like it needs almost 21.
[2025-05-13 11:55:46]  or I don't want to keep it as a big effect and go ahead further. And we can justify as this.
[2025-05-13 11:55:49]  as is it's not a deal.
